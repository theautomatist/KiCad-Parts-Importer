# Privacy Policy

This extension adds download buttons on LCSC.com and communicates with a local backend on your machine to create KiCad library files. The backend is required for the extension to function.

## Data Collection
We do not collect, store, or transmit personal data to the developer or any third parties. There are no analytics or tracking services.

## Local Processing
The extension stores its settings locally (e.g., backend URL, overwrite options, and selected library) using Chrome’s extension storage. These settings never leave your device.

The local backend performs all file operations on your machine. When you request a download, the backend may fetch component data from LCSC/EasyEDA to complete the conversion. These requests are initiated by you and do not include personal data.

## Data Sharing
No user data is shared with the developer or third parties. The only network communication is between the extension and your local backend, and between the backend and component data sources you request.

## Data Retention & Control
All data remains on your device. You can remove it by uninstalling the extension or clearing extension storage.

## Contact
If you have questions about this policy, please contact the maintainer via the repository issues page.
